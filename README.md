scrollbound
</h1>
<p align="center">
a small roguelike game about descending a dungeon, collecting spell cards and scrolls which you use to defeat enemies
</p>

## how 2 get
you can play the game locally by cloning the repo (or setting up a codespace by clicking `Code` -> `Codespaces` -> `Create codespace on main`), setting a up virtual environment, installing rich and rich_menu, then running \_\_main\_\_.py

the game was made with python 3.10, so bear that in mind

depending on how much replit has changed since i last used it, i may create a replit demo and drop a link here

## how 2 play
the core gameplay loop is simple and should be familiar if you've ever played a roguelike before! you begin by picking 2 spell cards (these are permanent and won't disappear), and 3 scroll cards (these are single use and disappear), then it's straight into the dungeon for you!

from there, it's standard turn-based RPG combat, fight enemies using your spells/scrolls (at the cost of your *T*urn*P*oints, which regenerates at the end of your turn), they fight you back, until someone dies

every 5 levels you'll encounter a scroll shop, every 10 you'll encounter a voucher shop

the game automatically saves your run every floor, so you can quit by simply Control+C'ing or closing your terminal, and pick back up where you left off whenever

this is another game by me, on behalf of rockbox studios.
